# Task7_Analysis_-Python-SQLite
ðŸ§¾ Analyzing Sales Data with Just Python + SQLite

 In my task 7, I built a basic Sales Summary tool using:
 ðŸ”§ Tools Used
 Python (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)
 SQLite (fully built-in, no setup!)
 Jupyter Notebook for code + visuals

  
ðŸ“Š What It Does:
âœ… Connects to a local SQLite database (sales_data.db)
âœ… Runs a SQL query to calculate:
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Total quantity sold per product
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€¢ Total revenue per product
âœ…  - Prints a summary DataFrame
âœ… Displays the output with a clean bar chart using Matplotlib



ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:
âœ… How to embed SQL inside Python
âœ… Load query results directly into pandas
âœ… Quick data visualization with no extra tools
âœ… Perfect for small apps, local tools & quick insights


ðŸ“Œ SQL Query Used

```sql
SELECT product, 
       SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, 
       SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product
